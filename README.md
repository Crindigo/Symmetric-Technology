Symmetric Technology contains a large collection of realistic machinery for GregTech CEu.

Most recipes are missing as this is meant to be customized by modpack authors.

The base code was written by Supersymmetry Developers. Removals, cleanup, and
package renaming done by Crindigo. Several parts were removed from this
repository to minimize dependencies and be less intrusive to gameplay.
Features related to Immersive Railroading, mob hordes, drop pods, space,
and armor were removed.
